# SOS Commitment

We as a company building SaaS are heavily reliant on and invested in Open Source. We cannot just be consumers and expect premium support from passionate individuals. We have a responsibility to make the world a bit better.


## Rewards
Open source is vital to our business. We build our software on top of the work of community heroes. The work shared by companies and individuals allows us to focus on our core business **without having to reinvent the wheel.**

## Risks
Next to all the benefits there are also risks involved. The security aspect of pulling in external code means that there is a responsibility to monitor what is used. Heavily depending on an external library or framework also means that there might be a continuity concern.


## Commitment
We will stimulate all efforts creating a healthy culture towards the use and contribution of OSS by:

- Sharing our code as open source as long it is not considered core business and has no security risk.
- Let our developers contribute code and documentation to relevant projects during business hours.

- Share our learnings with the world. Throught talks, blogs, videos and educational content.
- Teach our developers to communicate with maintainers respectfully. <COC link>
- Not forcing our agendas.
- Sponsor projects and maintainers that are crucial for our business. Dedicate X amount $ towards sponsoring dependencies. ()[Link to patronee(?) list]

## Rewards
By committing to the sustainable open source initiative
- Our code and documentation quality standard will improve.
