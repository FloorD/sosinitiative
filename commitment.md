# SOS Commitment

We as a company building software are heavily reliant on and invested in Open Source. We cannot only be consumers and expect premium support from passionate individuals. We recognize we have a responsibility to keep the ecosystem and the community healthy.

## Rewards
Open source is vital to our business. We build our software on top of the work of community heroes. The work shared by companies and individuals allows us to focus on our core business **without having to reinvent the wheel.**

## Risks
Next to all the benefits there are also risks involved. The security aspect of pulling in external code means that there is a responsibility to monitor what you depend on. Heavily depending on an external library or framework also means that there might be a continuity concern. 

## Commitment
We will stimulate all efforts creating a healthy culture towards the use and contribution of OSS by:

- Teach our developers to communicate with maintainers respectfully and follow the [developer-guidelines](developer-guidelines.md)

- Sharing our own learnings with the world. Though talks, blogs, videos and educational content.

- Sharing our code that could help others as open source as long it is not considered our core business, intellectual property and has no security risk.

- Let our developers contribute code and documentation to relevant projects during working hours.

- Not forcing our agendas to a project.

- Sponsor projects and maintainers that are crucial for our business.

## Effects
By committing to the sustainable open source initiative we believe we will have a positive effect on the community and on our own business. By getting familiar with the open source way of working our own code and documentation quality will improve. We will be a great place to work for like minded developers. The projects we love will blossom and might even become a primary source of income for the maintainer.
